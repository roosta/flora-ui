#+TITLE: Tonic
* Development
  You can start development mode by calling:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    lein figwheel
  #+END_SRC

  Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser. Once Figwheel
  starts up, you should be able to open the public/index.html page in the
  browser, or go to http://localhost:3333 for the development server.

  Another option is calling ~script/repl.clj~ from Emacs on
  ~cider-jack-in-clojurescript~ by including this in your Emacs config:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq
     cider-cljs-lein-repl "(require 'repl)")
  #+END_SRC

  Just ensure that script is on your ~source path~ which it is in this project
  already
